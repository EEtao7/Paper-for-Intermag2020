# TMAG2020 addtional material

This repository includes the supplement of the paper for Intermag 2020: Comparison of subdomain, complex permeance and relative permeance models for a wide family of permanent-magnet machines.

## 1. Detail information about the analytical models and finite element model

We use the analytical models and finite element model in the paper. Because of the limitation of the 5 pages for the paper of Intermag 2020, we add the detail information about the analytical models and finite models in the GitHub.

### 1.1 Description of the models

#### 1.1.1 Analytical models

We use the analytical models include subdomain model, complex permeance model and relative permeance models in the paper. We create them by the next references. We provide the pdf version of these reference in the document 'Reference of the models. rar'.

* Subdomain model

* Complex permeance model

* Relative permeance model

#### 1.1.2 Finite element model

  We use the FEMM  (21Apr2019 version) to create the finite element model. The description of the finite element model is shown in the next reference.

   We provide the pdf version of these reference in the document 'Reference of the models. rar'.

### 1.2 Programs of the models

Based on the theory in the above reference, we build every model by MATLAB. The detail program is listed in the document 'Program for GitHub. rar'. 

## 2. Error distribution changing with the key parameters

 Because of the limitation of the 5 pages for the paper of Intermag 2020, we add some figures about the error distribution changing with the key parameters in the document 'Error distribution changing with the key parameters. pdf'.
